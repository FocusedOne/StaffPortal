# StaffPortal
Convenient location for staff information

The initial idea for this was stolen from https://mp.olivebaptist.org/portal/staff.  It was some HTML in a Ministry Platform portal page.

This became an extremely popular tool for our staff.  We eventually found the Ministry Platform container limiting and broke it out into a separate HTML file.

The evolution of this file depicts me learning how to do this and progressively improving the code as I learned HTML and CSS in the modern world.
I hadn't written an .htm file since junior high - everything else has been wordpress or some other designer system.

As much as this particular incarnation of the page started as an experiment, it's now become a fun project in rediscovering creating web pages in a text editor.

It's also been a fun way to practice and learn GitHub for versioning.  Before, we had some dozen  named variants of "staffportalnewcssDATE" on the server.
This was OK when I was the only one looking at the file, but for a brief period another human had to work on it, so that brought up the idea of proper versioning.

Anyway, here's a pretty popular staff tool.  Feel free to strip all of the buttons out and replace them with your own.

Additionally, we've used re-used the shell (header, nav bar, footer) for other one-off sites that exist outside of our normal wordpress.

Most of the CSS is lifted from w3schools.  At one point they had a cert error which broke the w3.css file, so I duplicated it on our server.  Since then I've made some changes, as well as added a tiny bit more CSS in a separate file.
